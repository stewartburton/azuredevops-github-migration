# Changelog

All notable changes to the Azure DevOps to GitHub Migration Tool will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-15
### Added
- `--doctor-mode` composite flag for `doctor` command allowing direct non-interactive execution of specific modes:
  - `plain` (default diagnostics)
  - `fix` (diagnostics + `--fix-env`)
  - `assist` (diagnostics + interactive remediation `--assist`)
  - `fix-assist` (diagnostics + placeholders + remediation)
  - `edit` (open editor `--edit-env` then diagnostics)
  - `edit-assist` (edit + remediation)

### Changed
- Interactive menu simplified: single "ðŸ©º Doctor diagnostics" entry now opens a submenu instead of two separate root entries.

### Fixed
- Removed incorrect duplicate root menu item labelled "Doctor submenu (assist)"; improves UX clarity and keyboard navigation order.

### Documentation
- Updated internal docs implicitly via CHANGELOG (no user-guide structural changes required).


## [Unreleased]
### Summary (pending release)
- feat(naming): centralized repo & workflow filename normalization with collision handling.
- chore(types): phase 1 aggressive typing + lint alignment groundwork.
- docs: expand HOW_TO_GUIDE with normalization behavior.

### Added
- Automatic whitespace normalization in repository names: spaces are now converted to underscores "_" by default (e.g. "My Repo" -> "My_Repo") to prevent GitHub name validation failures.
- Global workflow filename normalization with collision handling (e.g. "Build & Test" -> `build-test.yml`, duplicates -> `build-test-2.yml`). Optional configuration via new `naming.workflow` section.
- `doctor --skip-network` flag to bypass outbound TCP reachability tests (useful for offline / restricted networks).
 - Interactive Analyze scope selector (single project vs full organization) with paginated, fuzzy-search project picker (mirrors quickstart UX: search substring/fuzzy, jump to letter, pagination, clear filter).
 - Interactive Migrate wizard: project picker then repository picker (same enhanced UX) plus mode selection (Dry run vs Real) and optional custom GitHub repository name prompt.
 - Reusable internal `_paginated_picker` helper in `interactive.py` enabling consistent selection behavior across features.
 - Fuzzy matching logic reused from quickstart for consistency (e.g. `aps` matches `Anthony_Project_Sandbox`).

### Changed
- Replaced terminology "organization slug" with "organization name" across interactive prompts, .env templates, and documentation for clarity.
- Enhanced placeholder append logic: canonical env variable lines are added (or supplemented with placeholders) even if an alias exists or an empty assignment is present.
 - Analyze action in interactive menu no longer immediately runs full org analysis; users choose scope explicitly, encouraging faster project-scoped first pass.
 - Migrate action no longer fails immediately due to missing `--project` / `--repo`; guided selection collects required inputs before invoking migration command.

### Fixed
- `doctor` assist submenu option 2 (append placeholders) now adds canonical lines when only aliases or empty values exist, preventing confusing "No new placeholders added" messages.
### Removed
- Secret management / required secrets logic from `scripts/verify-migration.ps1` and associated GitHub Actions workflow inputs (`required_secrets`, `fail_on_missing_secrets`).
- Converted/migrated pipeline workflow artifacts (e.g. `rick.yml`) from the tool repository to avoid bundling target migration outputs.
- Active verification workflow from `.github/workflows/verify-migration.yml` (moved to `examples/verify-migration-workflow.yml`).

### Added
- `-Json` flag for `verify-migration.ps1` to produce machine-readable summary (used by workflow PR comments & artifacts).
- `exit_code` field embedded in JSON summary for direct consumption by CI systems.
- `--allow-local-workflows` override flag to intentionally permit local workflow YAML emission (guardrail defaults to blocking local writes).

### Changed
- Exit code semantics clarified: `0` success, `2` warnings (non-fatal), `3` fatal (repository inaccessible or configured fail conditions).
- Centralized exit evaluation logic and removed duplicate code paths in verification script.
- Simplified GitHub Actions workflow to only require `org` and `repo` inputs.
- Pipeline conversion now generates workflows in isolated temp directories only; no `.github/workflows` files are written to the migration tool repository.

### Fixed
- Eliminated brittle direct `.Count` usage by introducing `SafeCount` helper, resolving intermittent `property 'Count' cannot be found` runtime errors.
- Ensured repository inaccessibility is treated as a fatal condition (adds `repository_inaccessible` failure reason internally).

### Documentation
- Updated README to remove obsolete secret parameter references and reflect new JSON mode & exit code behavior.
- Clarified branch protection and lint optional flags usage without secret complexity.
- Documented relocation of verification workflow; users now copy from `examples/verify-migration-workflow.yml` into their migrated repositories if desired.
- Added explicit warning that the tool repository no longer stores any converted workflow YAML; all previously committed migrated workflows were purged.

### Notes
- Further doc polish (HOW_TO_GUIDE, TESTING) validated to have no lingering secret parameter references.
